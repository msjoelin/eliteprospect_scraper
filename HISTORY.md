# eliteprospect_scraper
Package to scrape hockey data from eliteprospect

## [1.2] - 2024-09-12
### Added
- New function getGoalies(), to extract also Goaltender links similar to getPlayers(). 

### Fixed
- The getPlayers() now accepts input league "Hockeyallsvenskan" (swedish 2nd league) instead of "Allsvenskan". 
Allsvenskan is a legacy name used before 2012 season.
